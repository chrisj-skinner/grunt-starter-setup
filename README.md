#Grunt Setup

A simple clean grunt setup with both a development ```grunt ``` and build / deployment ``` grunt build ``` command.

Typing ``` grunt ``` will concatenate, uglify and compile with an expanded output for easy debugging.

Typing ``` grunt build ``` will concatenate, uglify and compile with a compressed output for final production deployment.
